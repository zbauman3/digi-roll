## Selecting A Die

To select a die, press the button for that die. While you are choosing a die, its light will flash to indicate it is selected. Once selected, spin the large D20 spinner to roll. The light for the selected die remains lit when your result is displayed.

## Selecting Multiple Dice

If you’d like to roll multiple dice of the same type (up to nine, such as `9d20`), simply press the die’s button repeatedly until you reach the desired quantity. The light will flash while selecting. When you’re ready, spin the large D20 again to roll all chosen dice.

After rolling multiple dice, the currently selected die’s light will stay illuminated. Press the die’s button to cycle through the individual results. To see the total of all the dice rolled, keep pressing the button until the `=` sign appears. The number shown at that point is the sum of your rolls.
