# Parts Info

<!-- These are all of the parts that were bought to build this project. There were some odds and ends that I already owned and cannot find a good link for (plugs, wires, etc). -->

## Filament

I used Prusa PETG for most of the filament. The colors used were Anthracite Grey (PETG) and Azure Blue (PLA).
